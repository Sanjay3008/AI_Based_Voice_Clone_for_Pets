    <string name="paragraph_pets">" Pets are not human but display a lot of human qualities like strong personalities, emotions, preferences, etc. While pets are mere domesticated animals for those who do not possess them, for those few who do they are not just dogs, cats, or birds; they are family.Pets work wonders for your body, soul, and mind. They stimulate your sense of well-being. They give you love, they give you laughter, but above all they give you happiness. They donâ€™t care about your looks, your financial status, your social standing, your creed, your race, your age, your state of health. They see you for who you are; minus the trappings of your daily existence. It is probably this quality of unconditional acceptance that sets pets apart from humans.Pets are not a cure, and not a substitute. They are a recommendation for happiness, fun, friendship, love, activity and better health."</string>
